//  Task 2: Real-world Operational System (Supermarket)
/// Aspect               Observations

/// Variability         - Customer arrivals change depending on time of day and week.
///                     - Shopping behavior varies: some buy only a few items, others fill a whole cart.
///                     - Service time is different for cash vs. card payments.
///                     - Product availability is not always stable (occasional shortages).
/// Complexity          - Multiple sections (bakery, meat, produce, dairy, etc.).
///                     - Combination of staffed checkouts and self-service machines.
///                     - Backstage processes like deliveries, storage, and restocking.
///                     - Employees with different skill and experience levels.
///                     - Discounts and promotions influence customer choices.
/// Interconnectedness  - Customer crowding slows down checkout and causes frustration.
///                     - Stock shortages lead to lost sales and unsatisfied customers.
///                     - Supplier delays directly affect shelf availability.
///                     - Insufficient staff impacts service speed, restocking, and customer experience.
